This all has my Data (Carlos Cortes)

You need to unzip the takeout folder.
and move the "Location History.json" from the takeout folder to this directory.

Then run "LocationToJson.py" (Don't forget you need your location history in the same directory) 
which will make "FilteredLocations.json" which holds an easier to read form of your location data

Then run "LocationJWork.py"  which will create "SearchList2.json" which is a filtered version of your search history (tokenized)

LASTLY run "SearchLocations.py" which mergest the two JSON files that we created previously together. The new file is "SearchLocations.json"




I cannot put my data in here because the file size is too big. So if you want it (which i am happy to give) just let me know and i can put it on my google drive or something like that.
